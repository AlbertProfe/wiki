## What is Git

- **what?** git is a version control system [(The git official repo)](https://git-scm.com/)
- **what?** git is a version control system [(The git official repo)](https://git-scm.com/)
- **how?** commits are snapshots, not diffs! [(The Git Object Model)](http://shafiul.github.io/gitbook/1_the_git_object_model.html) and [(Git Internals - Git Objects)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects)
- **where?** git is a key-value store  [(Key Value Store Concept)](https://www.bytefusion.de/2019/07/14/how-git-uses-key-value-store/)

## Key-ideas

- Git [stores](https://batmat.github.io/presentations/git-next-level/prez.html)  unique content and no duplicates
- Each key-value pair [entry](https://github.blog/2020-12-17-commits-are-snapshots-not-diffs/) contains a unique hash as a key: SHA-ID.
- There are only three types of values:
    1. blobs for files
    2. tree for directories
    3. commit for commit messages
        1. [Â commit message](https://blog.git-init.com/immutable-snapshot-in-git/)
        2. author, including a timestamp
        3. committer, including a timestamp
        4. reference to parent commit
