### THE RELAXATION RESPONSE
“Briefly stated, the relaxation response is defined as the response that is the opposite of the 
“fight-or-flight” or stress response. It is characterized by the following: decreased metabolism,
heart rate, blood pressure, and rate of breathing; a decrease or “calming” in brain activity; an
increase in attention and decision-making functions of the brain; and changes in gene activity
that are the opposite of those associated with stress.”
The relaxation response. As Benson says above, it’s basically the opposite of the “fight-or-flight”
response that most of us spend way too much of our time in these days.
Our bodies are brilliantly architected in such a way that, when faced with a life-threatening
danger, all systems necessary for our survival are activated: from our hearts pumping blood
to our legs so we can make a quick exit to adrenalin flooding our system so we’re as strong as
possible for a potential fight.
Now, back in the day when we needed to worry about saber-tooth tigers having us for lunch, that
fight-or-flight response mechanism was pretty sweet. Unfortunately, our body’s evolution hasn’t
quite kept up with our mind’s evolution and now a sideways glance from our boss or someone
cutting us off in traffic often elicits the same response. All. Day. Long.
That constant barrage takes a significant toll on our well-being. And, researchers have
discovered that our ability to induce its opposite relaxation response is H-U-G-E
