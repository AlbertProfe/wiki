## Overview



- If we don’t appropriately manage the ``open loops`` in our life, **our attention will get pulled.**
- ``Overwhelm`` comes from:
    - not **clarifying** what your intended **outcome** is,
    - not **deciding** what the very next action is, and
    - not **reminding** yourself of your intended outcome and action.
- You need to transform all the ``stuff`` you attract and accumulate into a **clear inventory of meaningful actions**, projects, and usable information.

## Five tips

Here are a few takeaways and tactics:

###  Done
Getting things done requires defining what ``done`` means and what ``doing`` looks like.

> What is ``done``? What is ``doing``?

### Attention
Mastering your workflow involves capturing **what has your attention**, clarifying what it means, putting it where it belongs, reviewing it frequently, and engaging with it.

> How de you see the world?

### Now!

If an action will **take less than two minutes**, it should be done at the moment it is defined.

> Save energy, do it now!

### Anixety

``Anxiety`` and ``guilt`` don’t come from having too much to do; it comes from **breaking agreements with yourself.**

> Your mind is for having ideas, not for holding them.
