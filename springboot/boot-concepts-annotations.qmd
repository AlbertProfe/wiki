ðŸ“˜ **Annotations**

In Spring Boot, annotations are used to configure and enable various features and functionality. They are used to provide metadata about a class, method, or field, and are used by the Spring framework to determine how to handle that class, method, or field.

Here are some examples of common annotations used in Spring Boot:

- ``@SpringBootApplication``: This annotation is used to enable the default configuration of a Spring Boot application.
- ``@RestController``: This annotation is used to define a class as a RESTful web service controller.
- ``@RequestMapping``: This annotation is used to map HTTP requests to specific methods in a controller class.
- ``@Autowired``: This annotation is used to automatically wire a bean from the Spring application context into a class field or method.
- ``@Entity``: This annotation is used to define a class as a JPA entity, which can be used to interact with a database.
- ``@Repository`` : This annotation is used to define a class as a JPA repository, which can be used to perform CRUD operations on a database.
- ``@Component`` : This annotation is used to define a class as a Spring Bean which can be used throughout the application.
