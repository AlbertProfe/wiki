ðŸ“˜ **Spring Boot Lab#SB00-3: Borrow Domain**

After [Lab#SB00-1](/springboot/sblab0-1.qmd) and [Lab#SB00-2](/springboot/sblab0-2.qmd) it is time to integrate and refactor the code created at projects:

- **Libray5**: `Book` domain (all CRUD operations)
- **controllerView**: `User` and `Librarian` domain (all CRUD operations)
- **LibraryProject**: from `Java SE` project we have the `business logic` of borrowing a book and the ``Borrow`` clas

## user-story & use-case

::: {.callout-tip}
## user-story
As a ``user/librarian``, we are able to access user's borrow domain from ``use/users`` web domain and perform such a operations:
:::

- create a new ``borrow``
- ``borrows`` ``HashMap``
- renovation ``borrow``
- return books
- close a ``borrow``
- findBorrowsByUser

And also:

- fake login and logout

### use-cases

- **Create a new borrow**: initiate a new record in the borrow ``HashMap`` for a user borrowing a book(s).
- **Borrows ``HashMap``**: a database ``HashMap`` that stores information about borrowed books, including user information and return dates.
- **Renovation borrow**: extend the return date for a borrowed book by updating the corresponding borrow record.
- **Return books**: update the borrow record to indicate that the borrowed book(s) have been returned.
- **Close a borrow**: mark a borrow record as closed to indicate that the borrowed book(s) have been returned and the borrow is complete.
- **Fake login as librarian or user**: simulate a login as a librarian or user for testing or debugging purposes.
- **Logout**: terminate a user's authenticated session.
- **Find borrows by user**: retrieve all borrow records associated with a particular user from the borrow ``HashMap``.

## Mock up

Creating a **web Thymeleaf app without CSS** means that the application's user interface will not have any styling. 

The focus of the app is to test Spring Boot's controller and service layers using data stored in ``HashMaps``. 

![Mockup Web Library Management core use-case](/images/springboot/LibraryManagementMockUp.png){width="80%"}

This app will be useful for testing and development purposes, as it allows developers to quickly **build and test the functionality of the controller and service layers without worrying about the presentation layer and the database**

::: {.column-margin}
However, it is not intended for production use, as a production app would require a more polished and professional user interface with styling and layout design
