## Overview

![Spring Boot](/images/springboot/springboot.png){.image-preview #spring-boot}

[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/) makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

If youâ€™re looking for information about a specific version, or instructions about how to upgrade from an earlier release, check out the project release notes section on our wiki.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class DemoApplication {

@GetMapping("/helloworld")
public String hello() {
    return "Hello World!";
}
}

```
