::: {.tab-content #goal}
### Goal
>In this project, students will be required to create a **web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. They will also need to understand and use **Markdown to format their project's documentation**. Additionally, they will need to use GitHub and Visual Code to manage their project's code and collaborate with their peers.

::: {.tab-content #tasks}
### Tasks
>In the first part of the project, students will create a **basic web page using markdown and publish it on Github repository** using Visual Code. This will involve creating a new repository on Github and learning how to use markdown to format text and create links.
>
>In the second part of the project, students will learn how to **publish their website on gh-pages**, a service provided by Github for hosting static websites. This will involve learning how to use the gh-pages service and how to deploy their website to the internet.

::: {.tab-content #optional}
### Optional
>As an optional study, students may also want to learn about using **callouts in their markdown documentation**. The following links provide useful information on the topic:
>
>- [markdown-callouts](https://oprypin.github.io/markdown-callouts/)
>- [Callout Blocks Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html)
>- [Getting Started with RDMD](https://rdmd.readme.io/docs/getting-started)
>- [Divs and spans](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#divs-and-spans)
>- [codepen.io HTML+CSS](https://codepen.io/dongmikim/pen/VwLqyjQ)
>
>Using **callouts, links, tabs and CSS** can help to improve the readability and organization of a markdown document, making it easier for readers to understand and navigate the content.
>
>To take their project to the next level, students may also choose to connect to an **API** (Application Programming Interface) to **retrieve data and render charts using JavaScript**. This will require an understanding of how to make HTTP requests and how to manipulate data in JavaScript.
