ðŸ“˜ **React JS Lab#RE04-1: feathers / spring boot**

In this lab, we will be using these server frameworks to feed our React `Todo` app through API Rest. For many reasons described below the use of a React App with a Spring Boot/Feathers server is a very good option:

- [feathers](https://feathersjs.com/){.external}, the API and Real-time light Application Framework over [Express](https://expressjs.com/){.external}.
- [Spring Boot](/spring/spring-basics.qmd): [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot){.external} makes it easy to create **stand-alone, production-grade** Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

## Overall

Creating a server for a React `Todo` application is essential for several reasons:

- `Data Persistence`: A server allows you to store and retrieve data from a database or a file system. In the case of a todo application, you need to store the todo items, their status, and any other relevant information. A server enables you to save this data and retrieve it whenever necessary, ensuring that the todos remain persistent even if the user refreshes the page or closes the application.
- `User Authentication`: If you want to add user accounts and authentication to your todo application, a server is required. It allows you to handle user registration, login, and session management. With a server, you can securely authenticate users and restrict access to certain features or data based on user permissions.
- `API Integration`: In many cases, todo applications need to integrate with external services or APIs. For example, you may want to sync todos with a cloud storage service or send notifications to users. A server acts as an intermediary between your React application and these external APIs, handling the necessary requests and responses.
- `Server-side Operations`: Some operations are better suited to be performed on the server side. For instance, if you need to calculate statistics or generate reports based on the todos, it's more efficient to offload these tasks to the server rather than executing them in the client's browser.
- `Scalability and Performance`: As your todo application grows and handles more users and data, a server allows you to scale your infrastructure to meet the demand. You can distribute the load across multiple servers or utilize cloud services that provide auto-scaling capabilities, ensuring optimal performance and responsiveness.



The `Todo` React code can be deployed and **served using various frameworks and platforms**, depending on your specific requirements and preferences. Here are some options:

1. **Spring Boot**: [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is a popular Java-based framework for building web applications. It provides a robust server-side environment for running React code.

2. **Feathers.js**: [Feathers.js](https://feathersjs.com/) is a lightweight and flexible Node.js framework that enables the creation of real-time applications. It can serve React code effectively.

3. **PHP Laravel**: [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is a powerful PHP framework known for its elegant syntax and expressive features. It can be used to serve React code alongside server-side logic.

4. **.NET C# Razor**: [Razor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor?view=aspnetcore-5.0) is a view engine that integrates with ASP.NET Core, a framework for building web applications with C#. It provides seamless integration of React code with server-side rendering.

5. **AWS**: [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) offers a range of services for deploying React applications. You can use AWS Amplify, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or AWS Lambda, depending on your specific needs.





## API REST Server with Feathers

- [Quick start](https://feathersjs.com/guides/basics/starting.html){.external}
- [Node.js CRUD App Using React and FeathersJS](https://www.sitepoint.com/crud-app-node-react-feathersjs/){.external}

You can create a new ``Feathers`` application by running

```js
 npm create feathers <name>
```
Once the ``Feathers`` CLI is installed you may keep with the project.

::: {.column-margin}
Since the generated application is using modern features like **ES modules**, the ``Feathers`` CLI requires ``Node 16`` or newer.
:::


You need to define your project.

- choose if you want to use JavaScript or TypeScript.
- When presented with the project name, just hit enter, or enter a name (no spaces).
- Next, write a short description for your application.
- Confirm the next questions with the default selection by pressing Enter.
- If you choose a database other than SQLite, make sure it is reachable at the connection string.
- using MongoDB is nece, change the database selection.

Once you confirm the last prompt, the final selection should look similar to this:

    Updated src/services/index.js
    Wrote file test/services/todo/todo.test.js
    Wrote file src/services/todo/todo.class.js


```

#### Initial render feathers project


After install and create, we could execute the project `npm start` and check the **endpoint**.

At browser, `http://localhost:3030/` (it is the base URL for a `Feathers` server) we will consume the data. 

By making HTTP requests to this `endpoint` using different methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), along with appropriate paths and parameters, we can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the corresponding resources exposed by the Feathers server, thus interacting with the API and manipulating data.

After check all CRUD operations are working we will use this endopont to serve our [React todo app](/reactjs/rjslab3-3.qmd)

## API REST Server with spring boot

Let's create a Spring Boot server. It will publish our todo API Rest with a `command-line runner` that interacts with a `Todo` model.

- Create a new `Spring Boot` project using your preferred IDE or the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/){.external}. Include the necessary dependencies for RESTful web services and JPA (Java Persistence API).
- Create a `Todo` `entity` class to represent our `Todo` model. This class will have the properties id, text, completed, author, and due.

```{.java .code-overflow-wrap filename="Todo.java"}
import lombok.Data;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import java.util.Date;

@Data
@Entity
public class Todo {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private String id;
    private String text;
    private boolean completed;
    private String author;
    private Date due;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters
}
```


- Create a `repository` `interface` `TodoRepository` that extends `CurdRepository` to handle CRUD operations for the `Todo` `entity`.


```{.java .code-overflow-wrap filename="TodoRepository.java"}
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.CrudRepository;

public interface TodoRepository extends CrudRepository<Todo, String> {
}
```

- Create a REST `controller` `TodoController` to handle the HTTP requests related to the `Todo` model.

```{.java .code-overflow-wrap filename="TodoController.java"}
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.util.Date;
import java.util.List;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/todo")
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class TodoController implements CommandLineRunner {

    private final TodoRepository todoRepository;

    @GetMapping
    public ResponseEntity<List<Todo>> getAllTodos() {
        List<Todo> todos = todoRepository.findAll();
        return new ResponseEntity<>(todos, HttpStatus.OK);
    }

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<Todo> createTodo(@RequestBody Todo todo) {
        Todo createdTodo = todoRepository.save(todo);
        return new ResponseEntity<>(createdTodo, HttpStatus.CREATED);
    }

    @Override
    public void run(String... args) {
        // Optional: You can add some initial Todos here if needed
        Todo todo1 = new Todo();
        todo1.setText("Example Todo 1");
        todo1.setCompleted(false);
        todo1.setAuthor("John");
        todo1.setDue(new Date());
        todoRepository.save(todo1);
    }
}

```

- Run the `Spring Boot application`, and the RESTful API for managing Todos will be available at `http://localhost:8080/todo`
- The `command-line runner` is implemented in the `run` method of the `TodoController` class. You can use it to pre-populate the database with some initial `Todos` if needed.
