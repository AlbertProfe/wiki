## Overview

ðŸ“˜ **React JS**

React.js is a JavaScript library used for **building user interfaces**. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React allows developers to create **large web applications that use data which can change over time, without reloading the page**.

It aims to provide a more **efficient and elegant way to manipulate the user interface** in order to create a more intuitive and smooth user experience.
:::

Some of the main features of React.js include:

1. **It is a single-page application (SPA)** framework, which means it allows developers to create web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update the page in response to user actions without reloading the page. This makes React applications faster and more responsive than traditional web applications.

2. **Components**: In React, everything is a component. Components are small, reusable pieces of code that can be easily combined to create complex user interfaces.

3. **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to improve the performance of components. The virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM, and it allows React to update only the specific components that have changed, instead of re-rendering the entire page.

4. **JSX**: React uses JSX, which is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code that can be compiled into JavaScript. This allows developers to use familiar HTML tags and attributes to build React components, making it easier to write and understand React code.

5. **State**: React components have a built-in state object that stores the local data of a component. The state of a component can be updated in response to user actions or other events, and the updated state will automatically be reflected in the user interface.

6. **Props**: In React, components can receive data from their parent components through props, which are essentially input parameters that allow components to be customized and reused. Props can be used to pass data, functions, or any other type of information to a child component.

7. **Routing**: React Router is a popular library that provides routing capabilities to React applications. It allows developers to define the different routes of the application, and to map each route to a specific component. This makes it possible to create a single-page application with multiple pages and views, without reloading the page.

## Key-concept: Hooks

In React, <mark>Hooks are a new feature introduced in React 16.8 that allows developers to use state and other React features without writing a class</mark>. They are designed to make it easier to reuse stateful logic between components, and to better manage side effects in function components.

ðŸ“˜ **Clear lifecycle**

Hooks allow developers to use state and other React features by writing **functions**, rather than creating class-based components. This makes it possible to use state and other React features without the **overhead of managing a class and its lifecycle**.
:::

For example, instead of using a class to define a component, you can use the useState Hook to add state to a function component:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the useState Hook is used to add state to the Example component. The `useState` function returns a pair of values: the current state, and a function that can be used to update the state. The current state is stored in the `count` variable, and the function to update the state is stored in the `setCount` variable.

Hooks are a powerful and flexible tool that can help simplify and improve the way you write React components. They allow you to use state and other React features without the overhead of class-based components, and they make it easier to reuse stateful logic between components.

ðŸ“˜ **Hooks and JSX**

They are a powerful tool for simplifying and improving the way you write React components, and they can be used to **combine the HTML, CSS, business logic, model, and navigation code of a component into a single, cohesive unit**.

:::
---

Here is an example of a React component that uses **Hooks to combine HTML, CSS, business logic, and navigation code in a single file**:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

import './styles.css';

function ExampleComponent(props) {
  const { data } = props;
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div className="example-component">
      <h1>Example Component</h1>
      <p>{data.description}</p>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
      <Link to="/">Back to Home</Link>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ExampleComponent;
```

In this example, the `useState` Hook is used to add state to the `ExampleComponent` function. The `useState` function returns a pair of values: the current state, and a function that can be used to update the state.

The current state is stored in the `count` variable, and the function to update the state is stored in the `setCount` variable.

These variables are used in the JSX code of the component to render the current state and to update the state in response to user actions. This allows the different types of code to be combined into a single, cohesive unit using **Hooks**.
