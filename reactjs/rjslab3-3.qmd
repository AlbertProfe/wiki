ðŸ“˜ **React JS Lab#RE03-3: ``API Rest CRUD``**

A `CRUD` (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Todo app with RESTful API integration:

- Using `Axios` and `Fetch`
  - `Axios` and `Fetch` are **JavaScript libraries used for making HTTP requests to the API endpoints.**
  - `Axios` or `Fetch` can be used to send HTTP requests to these endpoints, allowing data manipulation through CRUD operations.
- Fake server-side implemented with `MockAPI`:
  - by utilizing MockAPI, developers can create custom API endpoints to mimic server-side functionality.
- The Todo app allows users to `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete` tasks.
- This integration <mark>will build a fully functional Todo application with API communication and data persistence.</mark>

## mock api

> `MockAPI.io` is a web service that allows developers **to create and simulate RESTful APIs for testing and development purposes.**

![mockapi creating scheme-model](/images/reactjs/lab-re-3-11.png){width="50%"}

With `MockAPI.io`, developers can easily generate custom API endpoints and define the responses they want to receive when those endpoints are called. It provides a user-friendly interface to create, manage, and configure mock APIs, making it simple to simulate different scenarios and test how an application interacts with an API.

`MockAPI.io` supports various HTTP methods, request headers, query parameters, and response types, allowing developers to mimic real API behavior. It's a valuable tool for rapid prototyping, integration testing, and mocking data during development.

## axios

> `Axios` is a JavaScript library used **for making HTTP requests in React applications**.

It provides an **easy-to-use** and consistent API for performing **asynchronous operations**, such as fetching data from an API.

`Axios` supports features like interceptors, automatic request/response transformation, and error handling. It works both in the browser and Node.js environments and offers support for various request methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.).

`Axios` simplifies the process of making HTTP requests by providing a higher-level abstraction and allowing developers to handle responses and errors more efficiently.


## fetch

> `Fetch` is a built-in web API in modern browsers that allows **making HTTP requests in React applications and other JavaScript environments**.


It provides a **native and low-level way of fetching resources from a server**.

`Fetch` operates using Promises, **enabling asynchronous operations and providing a more modern alternative to the older XMLHttpRequest (XHR) approach.** 

`Fetch` supports sending requests and receiving responses, but it lacks <mark>some advanced features provided by libraries like Axios, such as automatic request/response transformation and interceptors.</mark>
