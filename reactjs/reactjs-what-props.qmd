## Passing Props to a Component

::: {.summary}

üìò **Props**

**React components** use **props** (``props`` stands for **properties**) to communicate with each other.

Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.

:::

![Props are properties passed to a child component that can hold many data types (e.g. array, object, number, function, others).](/images/reactjs/react_props.png){width="70%"}

In ``React JS``, data flows in one direction, **from Parent to Child**. This helps components to be **simple and predictable**.

:::

Use the same syntax as HTML attributes to send props into a component:

```{.js .code-overflow-wrap filename="profile.jsx"}
function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  // person and size are available here
}
```

```{.js .code-overflow-wrap filename="lin.jsx"}
export default function Lin() {
  return (
    <Avatar
      person={{ name: 'Lin Lanying', imageId: '1bX5QH6' }}
      size={100}
    />
  );
}
```

```{.js .code-overflow-wrap filename="carla.jsx"}
export default function Carla() {
  return (
    <Avatar
      person={{ name: 'Carla Lan', imageId: 'KIU3QH1' }}
      size={60}
    />
  );
}
```

## Stateful and Sateless

### Sateful Components

Functions that internally modify the underlying data (props).

```{.jsx .code-overflow-wrap filename="profile.jsx"}
function Hello({ name }) {
  //...
  return (
    <>
     <h1>Hello {name + ' - ' + (new Date()).toLocaleString()}!!!</h1>;
    </>
  )
}

export default function Hello() {
  //...
  return (
   <Hello name="World" />
  )
}
```

### Sateless Components

Pure components that respond to the underlying data received (props), without modifying it. A pure function is a function where the return value is only determined by its input values, without observable side effects.

```{.jsx .code-overflow-wrap filename="Hello.jsx"}
function Hello({ name }) {
  //...
  return (
    <>
     <h1>Hello {name}!!!</h1>;
    </>
  )
}

export default function Hello() {
  //...
  return (
   <Hello name="World" />
  )
}
```

## What is state and rendering: update/render cycle

[State variables](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/state-as-a-snapshot#setting-state-triggers-renders){.external} might look like regular JavaScript variables that you can read and write to.

> **However, state behaves more like a snapshot**.

Setting it **does not change** the state variable you already have, [but instead triggers a re-render](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/render-and-commit#step-1-trigger-a-render){.external} that will print a state variable copy with the new value.

::: {.callout-important}
State can hold any kind of JavaScript value, including objects.

But you shouldn‚Äôt change objects that you hold in the React state directly.

Instead, when you want to update an object, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set the state to use that copy.

[How it works in combination with spread opearator](/reactjs/reactjs-es6-spread.qmd#copying-objects-with-the-spread-syntax)  
[And what is a hook: useState](/reactjs/reactjs-hook-state.qmd)

> **Treat state as read-only**: in other words, you should treat any JavaScript object that you put into state as read-only.

``` {.jsx .code-overflow-wrap filename="App.js"}
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number++);
      }}>+1</button>

      <h1>{number}</h1>
    </>
  )
}

```

## So, Is React immutable?

The term **immutable** refers **to the idea that the state of a component should not be changed directly.** Instead, when the state of a component needs to be updated, a new copy of the state should be created with the desired changes applied.

This approach to state management can help <mark>to ensure that the state of a React application is predictable and easy to understand, as it makes it clear how the state is changing over time.</mark>

It can also make it easier to debug issues in your application, as you can more easily trace the history of the state and see how it has changed.

## And then, what is a mutation?

You can store any kind of JavaScript value in state.

```{.jsx .code-overflow-wrap filename="Hello.jsx"}
const [x, setX] = useState(0);
```

So far you‚Äôve been working with numbers, strings, and booleans. These kinds of JavaScript values are *immutable*, meaning unchangeable or *read-only*. **You can trigger a re-render to replace a value:**

```{.jsx .code-overflow-wrap filename="Hello.jsx"}
setX(5);
```

The ``x`` *state changed from 0 to 5*, but the number ``0`` itself did not change. It‚Äôs not possible to make **any changes to the built-in primitive values** like numbers, strings, and booleans in JavaScript.

Now consider an object in state:

```{.jsx .code-overflow-wrap filename="Hello.jsx"}
const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
```

Technically, it is possible to change the contents of the object itself. This is called a **mutation**:

```{.jsx .code-overflow-wrap filename="Hello.jsx"}
position.x = 5;
```

<mark>However, although objects in React state are technically mutable, you should treat them as if they were immutable‚Äîlike numbers, booleans, and strings. Instead of mutating them, you should always **replace** them.<mark>

## Examples

### Example 1: setting state only changes it for the next render

[In this example](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates#react-batches-state-updates){.external}, you might expect that clicking the ``+3`` button would increment the counter three times because it calls ``setNumber(number + 1)`` three times.

``` {.jsx .code-overflow-wrap filename="App.js"}
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

::: {.column-margin}
![Next render](/images/reactjs/ex37.png){width=100%}
:::

::: {.column-margin}
![3 Next render](/images/reactjs/ex38.png){width=100%}
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## Number is a state variable, not a regular variable
**Setting state only changes it for the next render**. During the first render, ``number`` was ``0``. 

And this is like this because number is ... **a state.**

So, during execution lines #10, #11 and #12, **``number`` value is ...0!**
:::


[This is why](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates#react-batches-state-updates){.external}, in that render‚Äôs ``onClick handler``, the value of ``number`` is still ``0`` even after ``setNumber(number + 1)`` was called .. **three times!!!**


### Example 2: State over time 

[State over time](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/state-as-a-snapshot#state-over-time){.external}, step by step how setting and render do not happen at same moment.


``` {.jsx .code-overflow-wrap filename="App.js"}
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 5);
        alert(number);
      }}>+5</button>
    </>
  )
}

```

::: {.column-margin}
![setting ``number`` state to 5, but first React will execute line #11, alert, and ``number`` state **still** is 0](/images/reactjs/ex40.png){width=100%}
:::

::: {.column-margin}
![Next render, ``number`` state now is now 5](/images/reactjs/ex41.png){width=100%}
:::

> Alert is helping us to understand why **setting and render are two different moments**

Setting ``number`` state to 5, but first React will execute line #11, alert, and ``number`` state **still** is 0


### Example 3: email

Here is an example of **how that makes your event handlers less prone to timing mistakes**. Below is a form that sends a message with a **five-second delay**. Imagine this scenario:

1. You press the ``Send`` button, sending *Hello* to **Alice**.
2. Before the **five-second delay ends**, you change the value of the ``To`` field to **Bob**.

``` {.jsx .code-overflow-wrap filename="App.js"}
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [to, setTo] = useState('Alice');
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('Hello');

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    setTimeout(() => {
      alert(`You said ${message} to ${to}`);
    }, 5000);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        To:{' '}
        <select
          value={to}
          onChange={e => setTo(e.target.value)}>
          <option value="Alice">Alice</option>
          <option value="Bob">Bob</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <textarea
        placeholder="Message"
        value={message}
        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

::: {.column-margin}
![Initial render](/images/reactjs/ex47.png){width=100%}
:::

::: {.column-margin}
![Next render](/images/reactjs/ex48.png){width=100%}
:::

React keeps the state values *fixed* within **one render‚Äôs event handlers**.

You don‚Äôt need to worry whether the state has changed while the code is running.

### Example 4: state updater function

It is an uncommon use case, but if you would like to update the same state variable multiple times before the next render, instead of passing the next state value like ``setNumber(number + 1)``, you can pass a function that calculates the next state based on the previous one in the queue, like ``setNumber(n => n + 1)``.

It is a way to tell React to **do something with the state value instead of just replacing it.**

``` {.jsx .code-overflow-wrap filename="App.js"}
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
    </>
  )
}
```
