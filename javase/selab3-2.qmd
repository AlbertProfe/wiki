ðŸ“˜ **Linux Lab#SE03-2: Library/Book Sprint Zero**

Before define what a [Sprint Zero really is](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/sprint-zero/){.external}, letâ€™s see what it isnâ€™t.

- A Sprint Zero is not the phase in which the team is put together. In order to conduct a Sprint in the first place, a team must already be in place.
- A Sprint Zero is not the phase for setting up infrastructure which should already be implemented or easily implemented on demand, but not as part of a Sprint Zero.
- A Sprint Zero should not involve adding products to a backlog or Consider Planning as classical project with Gantt Diagrams plannings.

The main goal of a Sprint Zero is **to deliver some usable value that can be built upon by the next team**. Sprint Zeros are required to:

- Create the projectâ€™s `skeleton`, including research spikes.
- `Keep design minimal`.
- Develop a small number of `stories` to completion.
- Be low velocity and lightweight.

More specifically, the deliverables of a Sprint Zero should be as follows:

- A `usable` piece of code, however small.
- A `minimal` environment for writing code.
- A `prioritization` of features or a list of stories.
- A `release plan` assigning each story to a Sprint.
- A plan for the most likely implementation of `features`.

# Sprint Zero jobs

## Onion Architecture

![Onion Architecture](/images/javase/onion_architecture.jpg){width="40%"}


The layers are of [Onion Architecture](){.external} and sublayers are:

- `Infrastructure`, where our database, file system, or any external web service we depend on live.
- `Tests`: unit, integration, end-to-end. How we validate our business cases. 
- `User Interface`, how our users interact with the code we have built. - Application Services layer (sometimes known as the Transport/Access Layer). 
- `Domain Services` layer. In this layer is where the majority of our business logic lives, it carries out the operations to turn A into B, input into output, egg into chicken. 
- The core layer, the `Domain Model` layer which is the representation of the high level data objects we use.
