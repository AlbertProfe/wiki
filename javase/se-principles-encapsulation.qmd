ðŸ“˜ **Encapsulation**

**Encapsulation** is the process of wrapping data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit. In other words, it is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world.

In Java, **encapsulation** is achieved through the use of access modifiers like private, public, and protected.

Here is an example of encapsulation in Java:

``` java
public class Account {
    // Private instance variables
    private double balance;

    // Public methods
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        // Code for depositing money
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        // Code for withdrawing money
        balance -= amount;
    }

    public void checkBalance() {
        // Code for checking account balance
        System.out.println("Current balance: " + balance);
    }
}


```

In this example, the `Account` class has private instance variables and public methods. The `balance` variable is private, which means that it can only be accessed within the `Account` class. The `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `checkBalance()` methods are public, which means that they can be called from outside the `Account` class. This ensures that the implementation details of the `Account` class are hidden from the outside world.
