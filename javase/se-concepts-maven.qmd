ðŸ“˜ **Dependency Management: Maven**

**Apache Maven is a software project management** and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a **project object model (POM)**, Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

Maven is a **build automation tool** used primarily for Java projects.

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) can also be used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages. The Maven project is hosted by the **Apache Software Foundation**, where it was formerly part of the Jakarta Project.

Maven addresses two aspects of building software:
- how software is built and
- its dependencies

## Maven Repository

Link: [Maven Central Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/)

<mark>Maven repository is a directory where all the dependencies such as jars, library files, plugins, or other artifacts that will be required by the projects are stored</mark>.

These repositories help us to store and maintain useful resources so that they can be used in our maven projects while building and deploying the artifacts.

All the layout and structure of the underlying repositories of maven of any type are **completely hidden for maven users**.
