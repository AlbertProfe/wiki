ðŸ“˜ **Dependency Management: Maven**

**Apache Maven is a software project management** and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a **project object model (POM)**, Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
:::

These tools allow developers to specify the dependencies for their project in a file, and then automatically handle the process of downloading and installing those dependencies. This can save a lot of time and effort for developers, and helps ensure that all of the necessary dependencies are present and up-to-date in a project.


## Maven

Maven is a **build automation tool** used primarily for Java projects.

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) can also be used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages. The Maven project is hosted by the **Apache Software Foundation**, where it was formerly part of the Jakarta Project.

Maven addresses two aspects of building software:
- how software is built and
- its dependencies

## Maven Central Repository

Link: [Maven Central Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/)

<mark>Maven repository is a directory where all the dependencies such as jars, library files, plugins, or other artifacts that will be required by the projects are stored</mark>.

These repositories help us to store and maintain useful resources so that they can be used in our maven projects while building and deploying the artifacts.

All the layout and structure of the underlying repositories of maven of any type are **completely hidden for maven users**.

## Maven Lifecycle

Maven is a **build automation tool for Java projects**. It is used to manage the build, reporting, and documentation of a project. Maven has a defined lifecycle that outlines the steps required to build and distribute a project.

![Maven lifecycle](/images/javase/maven-lifecycle.png)

The **Maven lifecycle** has three main phases:

- `clean`: This phase is used to clean up any previous build artifacts.
- `default`: This is the main phase of the lifecycle, where the project is built, tested, and packaged.
- `site`: This phase is used to generate the project's documentation and site information.

Each phase of the Maven lifecycle consists of a set of build phases, which are executed in a specific order.

For example, the ``default phase`` consists of the following ``build phases``:

::: {.column-margin}
Each build phase consists of a set of build goals, which are the specific tasks that are executed to accomplish the phase's objectives. For example, the compile phase has a build goal called compiler:compile that is responsible for compiling the project's source code.
:::

- `validate`: Validate the project's configuration and dependencies.
- `compile`: Compile the project's source code.
- `test`: Run the project's tests.
- `package`: Package the compiled code into a distributable format (e.g., a JAR file).
- `install`: Install the packaged code into the local repository.
- `deploy`: Deploy the packaged code to a remote repository for others to use.




By following the defined Maven lifecycle, developers can **easily build, test, and distribute their Java projects in a consistent and repeatable manner**.

## Archetype, GroupId, ArtifactId


::: {.callout-note}
An **archetype is a template for a project**. It provides a predefined **structure and files** for a project, so that you don't have to create them manually.
:::

GroupId and artifactId are two important elements of a Maven project. 

- The **groupId** is a unique identifier for a project, and is typically used to group related projects together.
- The **artifactId** is the unique identifier for a specific project, and is used to identify the project within the group.

Together, the groupId and artifactId help to uniquely identify a project within the Maven ecosystem.
