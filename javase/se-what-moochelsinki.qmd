## About the course

::: {.column-margin}
![Java MOOC Programming University of Helsinki](/images/javase/moochelsinki.png){.image-preview}
:::

Welcome to the University of Helsinki’s free [massive open online course (MOOC) on programming](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)! This is an updated version of our popular course **Object-Oriented Programming with Java.**

During this course, you will learn the basics of computer programming, along with algorithms and object-oriented programming through the Java programming language. The course includes comprehensive materials and plenty of programming exercises - all of which are tested using our automatic testing service Test My Code.

## Target

**Anyone can join - no previous programming knowledge is required.**

Unlike many programming courses found online, ours is completely unabridged; the course’s scope and material are identical to our CS1 Introduction to Programming and Advanced Programming courses.

::: {.column-margin}
This is the first course in our computer science learning track, and we use industry-grade tooling from day one. As such, the course is about programming in a real integrated development environment (IDE) instead of a browser or an educational IDE.
:::

The course does not require separate registration. You can simply dive into the first part of the course found over here.

## Course Contents

The course is split up into two individual courses:

- Java Programming I
- and Java Programming II

Each course consists of seven parts, each with its own exercise set. Completing a single part takes approximately 5-20 hours, and we recommend reserving at least 10 hours per part, depending on prior skills with computers.

### Log in to the development environment

Start the TMCBeans development environment you installed.
When the environment starts, it asks for your e-mail address and password.
Use the details of your MOOC.fi account you created in the previous step.

### Select your organization

The development environment asks the organization you do the exercises for.
Select the organization mentioned in the course material.
For example the organization for "Programming MOOC 2020" the organization is "MOOC".

### Doing your first coding exercise

::: {.callout-note}
Next we will go through step by step how you can complete the first exercise of "Programming MOOC 2020". Even if you are doing another course, read the instructions to the end because they contain important information about the development environment.
:::


**Download the exercises**

After you have logged in to the development environment and selected your organization and course, TMC will suggest exercises you can download (if there are any available). Download the exercises you want -- the exercises have to do with the course material of the course you have selected.

Now you should have the exercises downloaded to the development environment.

You can see the exercises listed on the left. Select the Projects-tab, and a small circles indicating completed exercises appear.

### Do an exercise

> Open exercise Part01_01.AdaLovelace.

Double click the exercise, and look for a source code file called AdaLovelace.java. 

Currently all source code files can be found from **"Source Packages"** directory in the exercise template.

You can open the exercise to the editor view by double clicking the file AdaLovelace.java. The editor view is the text editor at the middle of the TMC window, where you can make changes to the source code of a program.

Modify the source code so, that you see the following on your editor:

```
    public class AdaLovelace {
        public static void main(String[]args){
            System.out.println("Ada Lovelace :D");
        }
    }
```

### Running the source code

You can run the source code by clicking the Run button on TMC.

### Testing the source code
Exercises often have automatic tests, which give you feedback on your solution.

You can run the tests by clicking the Test button on TMC.

### Sending your solution to the server

Sending your solution to the server means submitting your exercise for grading. The exercises are almos always graded automatically, so you get your points (or a warning message) fast.

You can submit your solution either after all tests have passed, or separately by clicking the submit button on TMC.
