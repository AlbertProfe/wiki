## About the course

::: {.column-margin}

:::

Welcome to the University of Helsinki’s free [massive open online course (MOOC) on programming](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)! This is an updated version of our popular course **Object-Oriented Programming with Java.**

During this course, you will learn the basics of computer programming, along with algorithms and object-oriented programming through the Java programming language. The course includes comprehensive materials and plenty of programming exercises - all of which are tested using our automatic testing service Test My Code.

## Target

**Anyone can join - no previous programming knowledge is required.**

Unlike many programming courses found online, ours is completely unabridged; the course’s scope and material are identical to our CS1 Introduction to Programming and Advanced Programming courses.

::: {.column-margin}
This is the first course in our computer science learning track, and we use industry-grade tooling from day one. As such, the course is about programming in a real integrated development environment (IDE) instead of a browser or an educational IDE.
:::

The course does not require separate registration. You can simply dive into the first part of the course found over here.

## Course Contents

The course is split up into two individual courses:

- Java Programming I
- and Java Programming II

Each course consists of seven parts, each with its own exercise set. Completing a single part takes approximately 5-20 hours, and we recommend reserving at least 10 hours per part, depending on prior skills with computers.<!--- navLinks -->
