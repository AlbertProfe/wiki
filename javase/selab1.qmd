## Overview

Create a Maven/Gradle Java SE Project with three classes and Junit to test objects and operations.

> In order to complete this project, you will need to have a **basic understanding of the Java programming language**, as well as some familiarity with **Maven or Gradle for managing dependencies** and building the project.

> Additionally, you will need to have some knowledge of algorithms and data structures to implement the required classes.

> The goal of this project is to **create three classes in Java** that implement different algorithms or data structures, and to test them using JUnit.
>
> These classes could include, for example, creating new objects, a data structure for storing and manipulating data, or a utility class for performing common operations.

  <label for="tasks" class="tabs__label">Tasks</label>
  <div class="tabs__content">

>The tasks involved in this project include:
>
> 1. Creating a **new Maven or Gradle project** and setting up the project structure.
> 2. Modifying the project's `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file to import the necessary dependencies, including **JUnit** for testing.
> 3. Implementing the three required classes in Java, using appropriate algorithms and data structures.
> 4. Writing **JUnit tests** to verify that the classes work as expected.

  <div class="tabs__content">

> As an optional task, you could also consider **allowing the user to input data via the console**, rather than using `hard-coded test data` in your JUnit tests.
>
> This would allow you to test the classes with a variety of different input data, and to <mark>interact</mark> with the classes in a more dynamic way.

>Overall, this project will provide an opportunity for you **to learn and apply the basics of Java programming**, as well as gain experience with Maven or Gradle, JUnit, and user input via the console.
>
> By completing this project, you will have a staring foundation in these technologies and be able to build more complex and sophisticated Java applications in the future.
