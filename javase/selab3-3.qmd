ðŸ“˜ **Linux Lab#SE03-3: Library/Book **

In ``LibraryProject``, the ``User`` and ``Staff`` classes could have different ``operations`` that they are **authorize/able to perform.**

The ``User`` class could have the following operations:

- Search for books
- Borrow a book
- Return a book
- Check the status of borrowed books
- Update personal information


The ``Staff`` class could have the following operations:

- Add a new book
- Remove a book
- Update the book details
- Register a new user
- Remove a user
- Update the user details
- Generate reports on library operations

To ``implement`` these operations, we could define three separate ``interfaces``: 

- UserOperations
- StaffOperations
- GeneralOpeations

## Interfaces


The three interfaces ``GeneralOperations``, ``UserOperations``, and ``StaffOperations`` provide a clear separation of concerns and responsibilities within the library management system.

::: {.column-margin}
In a library project, having separate interfaces for different types of operations **will help to keep the code organized and maintainable**.
:::

> ``GeneralOperations`` ``interface`` provides methods that are commonly used by both users and staff, such as searching for books and creating an account.

> ``UserOperations`` ``interface`` includes methods that are specific to users, such as updating personal information, borrowing and returning books, and checking their borrowed books.

> ``StaffOperations`` ``interface`` includes methods that are specific to staff members, such as adding, removing, and updating book details, as well as registering and updating user details and generating reports.

By separating these different functionalities into interfaces, **it becomes easier to implement and maintain the system.**

::: {.column-margin}
For example, a developer could create different classes that implement the UserOperations interface, such as Student or Faculty, which will all have their own implementation of the methods defined in the interface.
:::

## Abstract class


Finally, the ``LibraryMember`` abstract class is a parent class for users and staff members, which includes common fields such as id, address, and phoneNumber.

By defining these fields in an ``abstract`` class, it allows for different types of users and staff members to inherit them and **avoid duplication of code.**



```java
public interface GeneralOperations {
    public void searchBooks(String query);
    public void createAccount();
    
}

public interface UserOperations {
    public void updatePersonalInformation();
    public void borrowBook(Book book);
    public void returnBook(Book book);
    public void checkBorrowedBooks();
}

public interface StaffOperations {
    public void addBook(Book book);
    public void removeBook(Book book);
    public void updateBookDetails(Book book);
    public void registerUser(User user);
    public void removeUser(User user);
    public void updateUserDetails(User user);
    public void generateReports();
}

```

::: {.column-margin}

Using ``interfaces`` and ``abstract`` classes in this way can make the code more modular and easier to maintain, as it allows for `greater flexibility and extensibility.`

## UML

### Previous drafts

The **two UML diagrams** describe the **core features** of a libraryProject, specifically the **use cases** for borrowing and issuing books, as well as the roles and responsibilities of users and librarians/staff members.

> The first diagram, ``Core features: borrow and issue``, depicts the **interaction** between the user and the system, as well as the system and the librarian:


- [Core features: borrow and issue](/javase/selab3-1.qmd#core-features-borrow-and-issue)

> The second diagram, ``Core features: user and librarian (staff)``, expands on the **roles** and **responsibilities** of users and librarians/staff members.

- [Core features: user and librarian (staf)](/javase/selab3-1.qmd#core-features-user-and-librarian-(staf))
