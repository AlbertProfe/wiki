# Beyond SCRUM


# [Is SpaceX using Scrum?](https://www.quora.com/Is-SpaceX-using-Scrum){.external}

## Pitch Elevetor

## Approach

![SpaceX is currently using a methodologies pool](/images/scrum/spacex.png){width=70%}

At the very beginning, when they were just a startup, they used all **Lean Startup** tips to achieve the success. They did **unscalable things**, bought some spares for rockets in usual computer shops, made some spares by themselves, etc.

All of these were a total craziness for classical aerospace companies. But it was the key benefit how they competed mastodons, like **Lockheed** and **Boeing**.

<mark>Testing of hypotheses, tight budgets, and continuous innovations made the appreciable contribution to company success.</mark>

> All Elon’s companies use **Silicon Valley startup approach** to achieve success. And this is what distinguishes them among all other classical companies from the industry

Perhaps, it’s [not a classical](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/12/reverse-engineering-spacex-to-learn-how-to-speed-up-technological-development.html) ``Scrum`` approach like software companies use, but it’s from the field of **Kaizen and The Toyota Way**. This is how startups should behave.

### Make requirements less dumb

- Your requirements are dumb especially if a smart person gives them to you because you may not question them enough. Everyone is wrong sometimes.
- People will put you in an unnecessarily small box. Make your box bigger.
- Requirements must have an owner (a person not a department) who is responsible for maintaining information about the need to continue.

### Always be deleting part of the process

- If you are not occasionally adding things back in, you are not deleting enough. 
- The bias tends to be adding things to processes which are “in case we need it”.
- This is how processes get out of control and lengthier than truly needed


### Simplify or optimize

- It is very common for smart people to optimize processes that should not exist. 
- We are trained to answer questions and solve problems… don’t be afraid to say that this problem is dumb

### Accelerate cycle time

- Go faster through each process.
- Don’t do this before you get through the first 3 steps


### Automate

- Find ways to achieve process steps with little or no human intervention or cycle time. 
- Create automated feedback and process controls
