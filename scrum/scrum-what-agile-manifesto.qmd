1. 
> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2.
> Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. 
> Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months,  with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. 
> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. 
> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. 
> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a  development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. 
> Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. 
> Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and  users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. 
> Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. 
> Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
11. 
> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. 
> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
