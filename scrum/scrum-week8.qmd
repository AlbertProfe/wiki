# Specialist

# First at all, the Team


<mark>According to the Scrum Guide, the **Development Team** “consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment. Development Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage their own work.”</mark>

Development Teams are hence essential to Scrum’s built-in checks & balances as the Development Team has the sole control over the Sprint Backlog and is watching over the Definition of "Done". Generally, Development Teams need to have the following characteristics to be successful:

- They are **self-organizing**. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;
- Development Teams are **cross-functional**, with all the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment;
- Scrum recognizes **no titles for Development Team members**, regardless of the work being performed by the person;
- Scrum recognizes **no sub-teams in the Development Team**, regardless of domains that need to be addressed like testing, architecture, operations, or business analysis; and,
- Individual Development Team members may have **specialized skills and areas of focus**, but accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole.


# The specialist role

The role of a specialist in a team can be crucial for the success of a project. Specialists bring deep expertise in a specific area, and their contributions can enhance the overall quality and efficiency of the team's work. Here are a few aspects of a specialist's role in a team:

- **Expertise**: Specialists typically have a high level of expertise in a specific domain, whether it's in technology, design, operations, or another field. This expertise is valuable for solving complex problems and making informed decisions within their domain.
- **Problem Solving**: Specialists are often called upon to solve intricate problems that require their specific knowledge and skills. Their ability to analyze and address challenges in their area of expertise can be critical for the team's success.
