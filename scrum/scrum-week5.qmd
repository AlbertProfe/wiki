üìò **Summary: SCRUM Week 5 - Mindset, the key to everything**


Week 5 of SCRUM focuses on the pivotal role of mindset in personal and professional success.

The mindset, **defined as a set of beliefs shaping one's perception of the world, influences decision-making, habits, and problem-solving.**

Stanford psychologist **Carol Dweck**'s research distinguishes between **fixed and growth mindsets**, emphasizing the transformative power of cultivating a growth mindset. Those with a growth mindset embrace challenges, persist in setbacks, and view effort as a path to mastery, fostering resilience and a passion for lifelong development.

The discussion extends to the importance of **purpose in life**, emphasizing happiness, impact, and service. The process of understanding personal purpose involves continual self-reflection. Additionally, the episode delves into the benefits of journaling for immediate and long-term health.

The **Soviet-Harvard delusion** challenges the idea that academic knowledge alone is superior, advocating for a process of random tinkering, heuristics, practice, and apprenticeship.

The shift in management paradigms, customer-centric approaches, and the significance of having **"skin in the game"** are explored. The concept of **antifragility** is introduced, encouraging individuals and organizations to thrive and grow stronger in the face of adversity.

# Mindset, overview

::: {.callout-note}
Your mindset is a [set of beliefs that shape how you make sense of the world and yourself](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-mindset-2795025). It influences how you think, feel, and behave in any given situation. It means that what you believe about yourself impacts your actions and output.

It is also decisive in **decision-making process**, creating **habits** and at **problem-solving**.
:::


According to Stanford psychologist **Carol Dweck**, your beliefs play a pivotal role in what you want and whether you achieve it.1 **Dweck** has found that it is your mindset that plays a significant role in determining achievement and success.

Mindsets can influence how people <mark>behave in a wide range of situations in life</mark>. For example, as people encounter different situations, their mind triggers a specific mindset that then directly impacts their behavior in that situation. 


# Fixed vs Growth mindset

![Fixed vs Growth mindset](/images/scrum/fixed_growth.png){width="80%"}


> I've seen so many people with this one consuming goal of proving themselves in the classroom, in their careers, and in their relationships.
> 
> Every situation calls for a confirmation of their intelligence, personality, or character.
> 
> Every situation is evaluated: Will I succeed or fail? Will I look smart or dumb? Will I be accepted or rejected? Will I feel like a winner or a loser?
> 
> ‚Äî‚Äî Carol Dweck

Carol Dweck's groundbreaking work explores the dichotomy between **fixed and growth mindsets**.

- In a **fixed mindset**, individuals perceive abilities as static traits, leading to a desire to appear intelligent and an aversion to challenges. This mindset can hinder learning and resilience.
- In contrast, a **growth mindset** involves the belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and perseverance.
  
Dweck's research underscores the transformative power of cultivating a growth mindset. <mark>Those with a growth mindset embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and view effort as a path to mastery. This mindset not only enhances learning but also fosters resilience and a passion for lifelong development</mark>. Dweck's insights have far-reaching implications, influencing educational practices, workplace dynamics, and personal development strategies, emphasizing the profound impact mindset can have on the journey toward success and fulfillment.

# Purpose


> ‚ÄúThe two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why."
>
> ‚Äï‚Äï Mark Twain

> ‚ÄúThe mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation...
> 
> A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind.
> 
> There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.‚Äù
> 
> ‚Äï‚Äï Henry David Thoreau


## What do we want from life?

The [first step](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-finding-your-purpose-most-important-thing-you-ever-will-harper) is to understand what we want from life. Although the answer is unique for each of us, there is a general answer underlying our responses, a common canvas and palette awaiting our brush strokes.  At the most basic level, we all want:

- **To be happy**. Also described as ‚Äúfulfillment,‚Äù ‚Äúlife satisfaction‚Äù or ‚Äúfeeling good.‚Äù <mark>A happy life is built with experiences of pleasant mood, meaning and engagement.</mark>
- **To have an impact**. People sometimes call this ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù or ‚Äúmaking the world a better place.‚Äù When one asks **‚ÄúDo I matter?‚Äù** he is asking whether he affects the world in a meaningful way. A simple way of thinking about impact is ‚Äúhelping others.‚Äù While ‚Äúhelping others‚Äù is typically associated with non-profit work, we can view all work through the lens of **service**.
- <mark>On a long enough time scale, products, services and roles must be valuable to someone or they will not last.</mark> It should be noted that the rewards associated with impact (compensation, recognition, etc) are only worthwhile in so far as they lead to our happiness or service to others (such as providing for our family).

## Your Personal Purpose

:::

<mark>The purpose process, then, is a series of questions you ask yourselves throughout your life.</mark>


Day by day, you affirm your worthiness to lead a happy life and your ability to make a positive impact on the world. You endeavor to discover what is most powerful, most motivated and most moral in you and seek to use that to serve the needs of others.


## Journaling


{{< video ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAZn9dF3XTo >}}

**20 de nov. 2023  Huberman Lab**

> In this episode, I explain a specific writing protocol shown in hundreds of scientific studies to significantly improve immediate and long-term health. I explain how to implement this specific protocol, which takes only four days and 15-30 minutes per day.
> 
> I also explain the mechanism for how the four-day writing protocol affects neuroplasticity (brain rewiring) and brain function in the short and long term. I explain how these brain changes positively impact our physical health, including our system's immune function and thus our ability to combat infections, improve sleep, reduce feelings of physical and emotional pain, lower anxiety, and bring about healing from traumas.
> 
> This episode ought to be of interest to anyone seeking better mental and/or physical health through the use of brief yet highly effective science-supported protocols.

Soviet-Harvard dellusion is that **academic knowledge is superior and that we must understand the mechanism in order to understand the effectiveness of phenomenology.**

# Who is on control

![](/images/scrum/Principle1%20Companies%20Depend%20on%20Customers%20and%20Investors%20for%20Resources.png){width="80%"}

<mark>The shift in management paradigms from the traditional approach of strict control in the 1970s to a more customer and investor-centric approach reflects broader changes in the business landscape, economic environment, and evolving theories of management</mark>. Here are some key factors that have contributed to this shift:

- **Globalization**: In the 1970s, businesses were generally more localized, and global competition was not as intense as it is today. With the advent of globalization, companies have had to adapt to a more interconnected and competitive world. This shift necessitated a focus on understanding and meeting the needs of diverse customer bases across different regions.
- Technological Advances:& Information Age:
  - **The rise of the information age**, particularly with the widespread adoption of the internet, has empowered consumers with access to vast amounts of information. This has given rise to more informed and discerning customers who demand transparency, quality, and responsiveness from the companies they engage with.
  - **Advances in technology have enabled more efficient communication**, data analysis, and production processes. Companies now have the tools to gather and analyze customer feedback in real-time, allowing them to tailor products and services to meet customer demands more effectively.
- Rise of **Shareholder Value** and **Private Equity**: In the 1970s, the focus was often on maintaining stable operations and hierarchical control. Over time, there has been a shift toward a greater emphasis on shareholder value. This change has been driven by the belief that by maximizing shareholder value, companies can attract more investment, which is essential for growth and competitiveness.
- **Customer-Centric Approaches**: The concept of being **customer-centric** has gained prominence. Instead of just producing what a company thinks is best, there is a greater emphasis on understanding customer needs, preferences, and feedback. Companies that prioritize customer satisfaction are often more successful in building brand loyalty and gaining a competitive edge.
- **Agile and Collaborative Management**: The hierarchical, top-down management style of the past has given way to more agile and collaborative approaches. With the pace of change in the business environment, companies need to be nimble and responsive. This requires empowering employees at all levels to contribute to decision-making and innovation.
- **Rise of Entrepreneurial Culture**: The <mark>entrepreneurial spirit has become more valued within organizations</mark>. Managers are encouraged to think creatively, take calculated risks, and foster innovation. This contrasts with the more bureaucratic and risk-averse culture that was prevalent in *some/most organizations in the 1970s.*

# Skin in the game

![Skin in the game](/images/scrum/skin.jpg){width="40%"}

::: {.callout-note}
**"Skin in the game"** is a concept popularized by author Nassim Nicholas Taleb. In simple terms, <mark>it means that a person should have a personal stake or investment in a situation. When someone has "skin in the game," they have something to lose or gain based on the outcome.</mark> This concept is often applied to decision-making and responsibility.
:::


For example, if you're giving advice on investments, having "skin in the game" means you have your own money invested in a similar way. This ensures that the advice-giver has a personal interest in providing sound and thoughtful guidance since they stand to gain or lose alongside those who follow their advice.

The idea is that when people have a direct, **personal connection to the consequences of their decisions,** they are likely to make more careful and informed choices, as they are personally accountable for the outcomes.


> Most people you run into in real life... plumbers, taki drivers, accountants, tax advisors, garbage collecotrs... pay a price for their mistakes.
>
>  -- Nassim Nicholas Taleb, *Skin in the game*

# Antifragile

::: {.column-margin}

![](/images/scrum/wrong_reallity_does.png)

:::

[Antifragile](https://fs.blog/an-antifragile-way-of-life/) is another concept introduced by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. <mark>It refers to systems, entities, or things that not only withstand shocks and uncertainty but actually benefit and improve from them. In other words, antifragility goes beyond mere resilience; it's about thriving and growing stronger in the face of adversity.</mark>

Taleb contrasts **antifragility** with **fragility** and **robustness**.

- **Fragile** things break under stress,
- **robust** things resist damage but don't necessarily get better,
- while **antifragile** things actively gain from disorder.

An example Taleb often uses is the **mythological Hydra**. Cut off one of its heads, and two may grow back. The Hydra is antifragile‚Äîit becomes stronger through adversity.

In practical terms, individuals, systems, or organizations that embrace antifragility don't just survive disruptions; they use them as opportunities for growth and improvement. This concept encourages a mindset that views challenges and uncertainties not as threats to be avoided but as chances to become more adaptable, resilient, and ultimately, stronger.

**Anitfragile rules**

- Stick to **simple rules**
- **Build in redundancy and layers** (no single point of failure)
- Resist the urge to suppress randomness
- Make sure that you have **your skin (soul) in the game**
- Experiment and tinker‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätake lots of **small risks**
- Avoid risks that, if lost, would **wipe you out completely**
- Don‚Äôt get consumed by data
- Keep your options open
- <mark>Focus more on avoiding things that don‚Äôt work than trying to find out what does work</mark>
- Respect the old‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälook for habits and rules that have been around for a long time
