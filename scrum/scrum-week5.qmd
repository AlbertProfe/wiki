# Mindset, the key to everything

Your mindset is a [set of beliefs that shape how you make sense of the world and yourself](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-mindset-2795025). It influences how you think, feel, and behave in any given situation. It means that what you believe about yourself impacts your success or failure.

According to Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, your beliefs play a pivotal role in what you want and whether you achieve it.1 Dweck has found that it is your mindset that plays a significant role in determining achievement and success.

Mindsets can influence how people behave in a wide range of situations in life. For example, as people encounter different situations, their mind triggers a specific mindset that then directly impacts their behavior in that situation. 


# Fixed vs Growth mindset

> "I've seen so many people with this one consuming goal of proving themselves in the classroom, in their careers, and in their relationships. Every situation calls for a confirmation of their intelligence, personality, or character. Every situation is evaluated: Will I succeed or fail? Will I look smart or dumb? Will I be accepted or rejected? Will I feel like a winner or a loser?
> — Carol Dweck

# Purpose


“The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.”
― Mark Twain

     “The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation... A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.” Henry David Thoreau

# The Soviet Union delusion

The Soviet-Harvard Delusion: Real knowledge comes from the process of Random Tinkering (antifragile) → Heuristics (technology) → Practice and Apprenticeship –> Random Tinkering (antifragile) → Heuristics (technology) → Practice and Apprenticeship

Soviet-Harvard illusion is that academic knowledge is superior and that we must understand the mechanism in order to understand the effectiveness of phenomenology.

# Antifragile

https://fs.blog/an-antifragile-way-of-life/

    Stick to simple rules

    Build in redundancy and layers (no single point of failure)

    Resist the urge to suppress randomness

    Make sure that you have your soul in the game

    Experiment and tinker — take lots of small risks

    Avoid risks that, if lost, would wipe you out completely

    Don’t get consumed by data

    Keep your options open

    Focus more on avoiding things that don’t work than trying to find out what does work

    Respect the old — look for habits and rules that have been around for a long time
