# SCRUM

:::{.summary}
ðŸ“˜ **SCRUM definition**

Scrum is a framework for project management that is based on teamwork, accountability, transparency and short time-boxed **iterative** progress toward a **well-defined goal**.

The framework begins with a simple premise: **start with what can be seen or known**. After that, track the progress and **adapt**, whenever it is necessary.

At the end of each iteration, the team holds two meetings: **one review** to show the work done for clients and to get feedback, and **one retrospective** to enable the team to reflect and improve.

## Introduction

``Scrum`` is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

``Scrum`` itself is a simple framework **for effective team collaboration on complex products.**

::: {.column-margin}
Scrum co-creators **Ken Schwaber** and **Jeff Sutherland** have written **The ``Scrum`` Guide** to explain ``Scrum`` clearly and succinctly.
:::

This section contains the definition of ``Scrum``. This definition consists of:

-  ``Scrum``â€™s roles,
- events,
- artifacts,
- and the rules that bind them together.

> Scrum is: Lightweight, Simple to understand and Difficult to master.

## ``SCRUM`` roles

### The Scrum Team

The ``Scrum`` Team is made up of the people who actually work on Product Backlog Items during a Sprint. In a software context, this group is most often called the Development Team. 

::: {.column-margin}
In other contexts, the **simple term Team** is often used.
:::

The ``Scrum`` Master and the Product Owner, while part of the overall ``Scrum`` Team, may or may not be members of the Team working on PBIs. There is **no Project Manager or Team Lead** in ``Scrum``.

> Everyone is simply an equal member of the Team. 

The ``Scrum`` team is:

1. Transcendent 
2. Autonomous 
3. Cross-Functional

### ``Scrum`` Master

The ``Scrum`` Master is tasked with making ``Scrum`` work. They work intimately with the Team, sometimes as a member. Their primary task is to remove Impediments and guide the team in ``Scrum`` practices.

::: {.column-margin}
The **``Scrum`` Master** does whatever it takes to help the team succeed.
:::

**``Scrum`` Masters** are servant-leaders, not managers. They play the pivotal role of making sure ``Scrum`` is practiced well. The **``Scrum`` Master** is accountable for the Velocity and the Continuous Improvement of the Team.

### Product Owner

The **Product Owner** is the Team member who knows what the customer wants and the relative business value of those wants. He or she can then translate the customer's wants and values back to the ``Scrum`` team.

::: {.column-margin}
The **Product Owner** must know the business case for the product and what features the customers wants. 
:::

He must be available to consult with the team to make sure they are correctly implementing the product vision. Most importantly, he must have the authority to make all decisions necessary to complete the project.

## Agile Manifesto Four Foundations

Through this work we have come to value:

1. 
> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. 
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. 
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. 
> **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, **we value the items on the left more.**


## [Is SpaceX using Scrum?](https://www.quora.com/Is-SpaceX-using-Scrum){.external}

![SpaceX is currently using a methodologies pool](/images/scrum/spacex.png){width=70%}

At the very beginning, when they were just a startup, they used all Lean Startup tips to achieve the success. They did unscalable things, bought some spares for rockets in usual computer shops, made some spares by themselves, etc. 

::: {.column-margin}
All of these were a total craziness for classical aerospace companies. But it was the key benefit how they competed mastodons, like **Lockheed** and **Boeing**. 
:::

Testing of hypotheses, tight budgets, and continuous innovations made the appreciable contribution to company success. 

> All Elonâ€™s companies use Silicon Valley startup approach to achieve success. And this is what distinguishes them among all other classical companies from the industry

Perhaps, itâ€™s not a classical ``Scrum`` approach like software companies use, but itâ€™s from the field of Kaizen and The Toyota Way. This is how startups should behave.
