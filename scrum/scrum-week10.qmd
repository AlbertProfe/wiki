Toyota SCRUM

Taiichi Ohno

    You are a cost >>> First reduce waste.

    First say, "I can do it." >>>  And try before everything.

    The workplace is a teacher >>> You can find answers only in the workplace.

    Do anything immediately  >>> Starting something right now is the only way to win.

    Once you start something, persevere with it >>> Do not give up until you finish it.

    Explain difficult things in an easy-to-understand manner >>> Repeat things that are easy to understand.

    Waste is hidden. Do not hide it >>>  Make problems visible.

    Valueless motions are equal to shortening one's life.

    Re-improve what was improved for further improvement.

    Wisdom is given equally to everybody. The point is whether one can exercise it.
