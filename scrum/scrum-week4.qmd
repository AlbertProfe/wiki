# ScrumMaster, how it works


> Organizations across all industries globally are hiring **Scrum masters** because they are experts in handling challenging tasks.
>
> They address complex issues during the lifecycle of a project, ranging from motivating, leading, and training the team to respect the timelines; coordinating with the stakeholders, product owners, managers, and developers; and onboarding project teams.


A **Scrum master** acts as a bridge between a product/business owner to facilitate accountability at every level. 
<mark>They ensure that everyone is **on the same page** and help the team meet deadlines and deliverables within **budget.**</mark>

Changes as a **Scrum Master**:

- Product vision
- More ownership
- Better quality

# How ScrumMaster relates to others

The Scrum Master serves the **Scrum Team in several ways**, including:

- Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality;
- Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done;
- Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress; and,
- Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox.

The Scrum Master serves the **Product Owner in several ways,** including:

- Helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management;
- Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;
- Helping establish empirical product planning for a complex environment; and,
- Facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.

The Scrum Master serves **the organization in several ways**, including:

- [Leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/scrum-master-works-three-levels);
- Planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organization;
- Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work; and,
- Removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.

# Servant-leader

[Servant leadership](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/servant-leadership.asp) and traditional leadership employ different techniques and offer vastly different outcomes.

![Servant Leadership](/images/scrum/servantleader.png)

::: {.callout-important}
With a **traditional leadership approach**, the leader encourages people to do their jobs by providing them with **guidance, direction and motivation**.

The main focus of a traditional leader is to improve the business position of the company or the organization in the market.
:::

<mark>A servant leader shares power, puts the needs of the employees first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible</mark>. 

Instead of the people working to serve the leader, **the leader exists to serve the people**. As stated by its founder, **Robert K. Greenleaf**, a Servant Leader should be focused on:

> "Do those served grow as persons? Do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants?"

::: {.callout-tip}
Servant leadership occurs when t**he leader's main goal and responsibility is to provide service to their people**.

A servant leader focuses on the people that are directly below them, rather than the company as a whole. In servant leadership, the leader ensures that the followers are growing in all areas — their profession, knowledge, autonomy and even their health and physical development.

# On the same page

When using the idiomatic phrase **on the same page**, <mark>you are referring to a situation where two or more people generally agree or understand the same situation.</mark> This can be related to a specific event or given information, or it can infer an assumption or body of knowledge.

Despite its very [literal inception](https://theteamcanvas.com/) of two or more people being on the same physical book page, when used figuratively, it creates an analogy to help explain that the [parties involved have the same understanding of something.](https://www.scrum.org/resources/its-important-be-same-page)
