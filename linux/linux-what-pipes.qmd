ðŸ“˜ **Linux**

A **pipe** is a command that allows you to **redirect the output of one command as the input to another command**. 

It is represented by the vertical bar symbol ``|``.

## Introduction

For example, you can use the **pipe command to list all the files in a directory**, and then use the ``grep`` command to search for a **specific string in those files**:

``` bash
ls | grep "devtools"
```

This will list all the files in the current directory and then search for the string **"devtools"** in the output of the `ls` command.

You can also use multiple pipes to chain together multiple commands. For example:

``` bash
ls | grep "devtools" | sort
```

This will list **all the files in the current directory, search for the string "devtools"** in the output of the `ls` command, and then **sort the output alphabetically**.

## ``grep``

 ``grep`` searches for patterns in text. It stands for **global regular expression print**, and it allows you to **search for specific patterns of characters in one or more files.**

You can use `grep` to search for a specific word or phrase in a file, or you can use it to search for more complex patterns using **regular expressions.**

Here are a few examples of how `grep` can be used:

To search for a **specific word in a file**:

``` bash
grep "word" file.txt
```

To search for a **specific word in multiple files**:

``` bash
grep "word" file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

To search for a **word that starts with a specific letter**:

``` bash
grep "^w" file.txt
```

To search for a **word that ends with a specific letter**:

``` bash
grep "w$" file.txt
