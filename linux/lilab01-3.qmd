ğŸ“˜ **Linux Lab#LI01-3: Adjust user permissions**

-   Log in using the user account you created during installation. Use theÂ `sudo`Â command to gain root privileges when you need to perform systemwide administrative tasks. This is an important best practice in Linux administration.
-   Adjust the privileges assigned to your user account by using theÂ `sudo`Â command. You need to edit theÂ `/etc/sudoers`Â file by using theÂ `visudo`Â command.
