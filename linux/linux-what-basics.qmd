ðŸ“˜ **Linux**

Linux is a **free and open-source operating system**. It is a **Unix-like operating system that is based on the Linux kernel**, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is commonly used in web servers, smartphones, and other devices where reliability, security, and performance are important.

## Bash

**Bash (short for "Bourne again shell")** is a Unix shell and command language which was the default shell on Unix systems at the time. <mark>Bash is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to enter commands and execute programs, as well as perform various other tasks such as managing files, manipulating text, and interacting with other programs.</mark> 

Bash is **the default shell on many Linux systems**, as well as on **macOS** and other **Unix-like** operating systems.

## More on bash

Bash is a powerful and flexible tool that is widely used by developers, system administrators, and other users to automate tasks, write scripts, and perform other types of command-line operations. It is particularly useful for managing and interacting with large numbers of files and directories, as well as for automating repetitive tasks. Bash scripts can be used to automate a wide variety of tasks, such as setting up and configuring systems, performing backups, and managing network resources. Bash is also widely used as a programming language, with a syntax and structure that is similar to other programming languages.

In addition to its many features and capabilities, Bash is also highly customizable, with a variety of options and settings that allow users to customize its behavior and appearance. Users can customize their Bash environment by modifying the Bash configuration file, known as the "bashrc" file, which contains a set of commands and settings that are executed every time Bash is launched.

## Basic commands

Here are some basic terminal commands that can be used in Linux Mint:

- `pwd`: Print the name of the current working directory (i.e., show the full path to the current directory)
- `ls`: List the contents of the current directory
- `cd`: Change the current working directory
- `mkdir`: Create a new directory
- `rmdir`: Remove an empty directory
- `touch`: Create a new file or update the timestamp of an existing file
- `cp`: Copy a file or directory
- `mv`: Move or rename a file or directory
- `rm`: Remove a file
- `man`: Display the manual page for a command
- `sudo`: Run a command with superuser privileges
- `apt-get` is a command-line utility for managing packages in the Linux operating system. It is used to **install, update, and remove packages from the system**. apt-get is part of the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) system, which is used to manage software packages in the Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions.


These are just a few examples of the many commands that are available in Linux. To learn more about a specific command, you can use the `man` command to view its manual page. 

For example, to learn more about the `ls` command, you could type `man ls` in the terminal.

## Getting software: wget, apt-get, etc

- In Linux, `wget` is a command-line utility that allows you to download files from the internet. It can be used to download files from HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP servers.
- `apt-get` is a package manager for the Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions. It allows you to install, update, and remove software packages from your system.
- `snap` is a package manager developed by Canonical, the company behind the Ubuntu Linux distribution. It allows you to install and manage software packages in a consistent and secure way, and is designed to work across a wide range of Linux distributions.
- There are other similar package managers in Linux, such as `yum` for Red Hat and CentOS, and `dnf` for Fedora. These package managers allow you to easily install, update, and remove software packages on your system.
