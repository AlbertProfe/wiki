ðŸ“˜ **Linux**

Linux is a **free and open-source operating system**. It is a **Unix-like operating system that is based on the Linux kernel**, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is commonly used in web servers, smartphones, and other devices where reliability, security, and performance are important.

## Basic commands

Here are some basic terminal commands that can be used in Linux Mint:

- `pwd`: Print the name of the current working directory (i.e., show the full path to the current directory)
- `ls`: List the contents of the current directory
- `cd`: Change the current working directory
- `mkdir`: Create a new directory
- `rmdir`: Remove an empty directory
- `touch`: Create a new file or update the timestamp of an existing file
- `cp`: Copy a file or directory
- `mv`: Move or rename a file or directory
- `rm`: Remove a file
- `man`: Display the manual page for a command
- `sudo`: Run a command with superuser privileges
- `apt-get` is a command-line utility for managing packages in the Linux operating system. It is used to **install, update, and remove packages from the system**. apt-get is part of the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) system, which is used to manage software packages in the Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions.


These are just a few examples of the many commands that are available in Linux. To learn more about a specific command, you can use the `man` command to view its manual page. 

For example, to learn more about the `ls` command, you could type `man ls` in the terminal.

## Getting software: wget, apt-get, etc

- In Linux, `wget` is a command-line utility that allows you to download files from the internet. It can be used to download files from HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP servers.
- `apt-get` is a package manager for the Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions. It allows you to install, update, and remove software packages from your system.
- `snap` is a package manager developed by Canonical, the company behind the Ubuntu Linux distribution. It allows you to install and manage software packages in a consistent and secure way, and is designed to work across a wide range of Linux distributions.
- There are other similar package managers in Linux, such as `yum` for Red Hat and CentOS, and `dnf` for Fedora. These package managers allow you to easily install, update, and remove software packages on your system.
