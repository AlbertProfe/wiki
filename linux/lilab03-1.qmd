ðŸ“˜ **Linux Lab#LI03-1: Manage users and groups**

-   Use theÂ `/etc/skel`Â directory to define profile settings before adding any user accounts.
-   Set password and account expirations using theÂ `/etc/login.defs`Â file before adding any user accounts. Use the following password requirements:
    -   Passwords should expire after 90 days, with a five-day warning period.
-   Use the command line toÂ [create five user accounts](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-user-group-management)Â to use in later activities. You will experiment with permissions and ownership by using these accounts. Give each user a unique name but set them all with the same password (for your own sanity).
-   Use the command line to create five groups based on fictitious departments: sales, marketing, human resources, IT, engineering. Place one user from above into each group.
-   Delegate the ability to reboot the system to only one user by usingÂ `sudo`.
