## What is a virtual machine

::: {.summary}
A **virtual machine is a software program that emulates the functionality of a physical computer**.

It allows a computer to run multiple operating systems and applications in **isolated environments**, providing a level of isolation and security between them.

This allows users to run **different operating systems and applications on the same physical computer**, providing a level of flexibility and convenience that is not possible with a physical computer.

## What is Virtualbox
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is a **free and open-source virtualization platform** that allows users to run multiple operating systems on a single physical computer.

It is a type of **hypervisor**, which means it sits between the physical hardware and the operating system, allowing multiple operating systems to run on the same hardware.

VirtualBox allows users to **create and manage** virtual machines, each of which can run a different operating system and be configured with its own virtual hardware. This allows users to run multiple operating systems and applications on the same computer, providing a level of flexibility and convenience that is not possible with a physical computer.


## Step-by-step: Linux Mint
Here are the steps to create a **Linux Mint virtual machine using VirtualBox** on <mark>Windows</mark>:

1. Download and **install** VirtualBox on your computer.
2. Start VirtualBox and click the `New` button to create a new virtual machine.
3. In the `Create Virtual Machine` wizard, give your virtual machine a name and select Linux as the operating system type and Mint as the version.
4. Select the amount of **memory (RAM)** you want to allocate to the virtual machine and click `Next`.
5. Select `Create a virtual hard disk` now and click `Create`.
6. In the C`reate a virtual hard disk` wizard, select `VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)` as the disk type and **`Dynamically allocated`** as the storage type.
7. Select the location where you want to store the virtual disk and the size of the disk, and click `Create`.
8. Click on the new virtual machine in the list and click the `Start` button to boot the virtual machine.
9. In the `select start-up disk` window, select the **Linux Mint ISO file** that you previously downloaded from [Linux Mint 21 "Vanessa"](https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=299) and click `Start`. 
    9.1. If not, manually select ISO to **Controller:IDE>Optic unit>Choose file**
10. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Linux Mint on the virtual machine.
11. Remove the iso from the **Controller:IDE>Optic unit>Choose file**.
12. Once the installation is complete, you can use the virtual machine to **run Linux Mint and any applications that are compatible with the operating system**. You can also customize the virtual machine's settings and virtual hardware to suit your needs.
13. Install **Guest Additions**:
