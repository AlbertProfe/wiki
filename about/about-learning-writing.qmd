## The Elements of Style

 William Strunk and E.B. Whiteâ€™s short and famous book, ``The Elements of Style``.

::: {.summary}
**Rule 17**

A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.

This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all details and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.

### Composition

> **Design** - choose a structure in advance, when planning what to write, and hold onto it.

> **Paragraphs** - the primary compositional unit of writing. Each paragraph should be about an individual topic or speech. Begin paragraphs with a sentence that gives the topic or helps with the transition. Break paragraphs apart if it helps the reader, not just for the hell of it.

'After the paragraph has been written, examine it to see whether division will improve it.' (Page 32)

> **Active voice** - it's much better to use the active voice in most cases. E.g.:

- 'A report was prepared,' is not as good as;
- 'He prepared a report.'

> **Not** - say what things are. Don't waste your time saying what they are not.

> **Be definit**e - do not dance around the truth express it in concrete terms.

> **Omit needless words** - 'this is a subject that' can better be written as 'this subject'.

> **Summaries and Tenses** - in a summary, or anywhere really, pick a tense and stick to it, otherwise you'll confuse the reader.

> **Emphasis** - put the word or words you want to emphasise at the end of a sentence
