## The Elements of Style

 William Strunk and E.B. Whiteâ€™s short and famous book, ``The Elements of Style``.

::: {.summary}
**Rule 17**

A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.

This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all details and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.
